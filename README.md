## ðŸ¤” Assumptions & Clarifications:
1. **_.env_** file would usually be git ignored, did not ignore it for the sake of your convenience guys.
2. Rate limiting & request slow downs are implemented naively using requester's ip address in-memory. For production, I would probably use a data store (remote server memory or disk).
3. The account and followers data is cached on the server RAM. In a production use case, the caching would have been implemented in a more sophisticated way, if needed.
